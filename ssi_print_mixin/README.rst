==================
Print Policy Mixin
==================

``ssi_print_mixin`` provides a standardised print-document framework that adds
a configurable *Print* button to any Odoo model via an abstract mixin.

The module ships the following components:

* **mixin.print_document** \u2014 abstract mixin that automatically injects a
  *Print* button into the form-view header and list-view header when
  ``_automatically_insert_print_button = True`` on the subclass.
* **print_document_type** \u2014 a named document type (scoped to a specific
  model) that groups the reports available for printing; its ``code`` is
  generated from a sequence.
* **ir.actions.report** extension \u2014 adds ``print_document_type_ids`` to link
  reports to types, a ``print_python_code`` condition evaluated at print time,
  and a ``print_multi`` flag for batch printing.
