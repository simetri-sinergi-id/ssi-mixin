============
Policy Mixin
============

``ssi_policy_mixin`` provides an abstract Odoo model — ``mixin.policy`` — that
implements a *policy-template* mechanism for controlling which action buttons
are available on a document at any given time.

Each inheriting model declares boolean policy fields (e.g. ``confirm_ok``,
``cancel_ok``) via ``_get_policy_field`` and links to a ``policy.template``
that evaluates Python conditions against the current record to set those fields
automatically.

* **policy.template** — master-data record holding Python evaluation code
  (matching criteria) and ordered detail lines.
* **policy.template.detail** — maps a policy field to its computed value
  for records that match the template.
* ``action_reload_policy_template`` — manually re-selects the active
  template based on the record’s current state.
