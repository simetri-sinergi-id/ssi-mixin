========================================
res.currency Many2one Configurator Mixin
========================================
``ssi_res_currency_m2o_configurator_mixin`` provides an abstract Odoo model
— ``mixin.res_currency_m2o_configurator`` — that adds configurable
filtering for ``res.currency`` Many2one fields.

The three filter strategies (manual, domain, Python code) follow the same
pattern as ``ssi_m2o_configurator_mixin``. This mixin is used by type/category
models that need to restrict which currencies a derived transactional record
may choose.
