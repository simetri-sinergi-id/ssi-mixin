====================
Operating Unit Mixin
====================
``ssi_operating_unit_mixin`` provides two abstract Odoo models that add
operating-unit awareness to any model.

* **mixin.single_operating_unit** — adds a single ``operating_unit_id``
  Many2one field, defaulting to the current user’s default operating unit.
* **mixin.multiple_operating_unit** — adds an ``operating_unit_ids``
  Many2many field for records that can span multiple operating units.

The module also extends ``ir.sequence`` with
``mixin.multiple_operating_unit`` so that sequences can be scoped to
specific operating units.
