====================================
Product Line Mixin - With Accounting
====================================
``ssi_product_line_account_mixin`` extends ``mixin.product_line_price`` with
accounting fields.

Any model that inherits from ``mixin.product_line_account`` additionally
gains:

* ``tax_ids`` (``account.tax``) and a computed tri-amount breakdown:
  ``price_subtotal`` (excl. tax), ``price_tax``, and ``price_total``
  (incl. tax) using Odoo’s ``compute_all`` mechanism.
* ``account_id`` (``account.account``) and ``analytic_account_id`` for
  journal-entry posting.
* ``usage_id`` (``product.usage_type``) with onchange handlers that
  auto-fill ``account_id`` and ``tax_ids`` from the product’s configuration.
