Related Attachment Mixin
========================

``ssi_related_attachment_mixin`` provides a structured required-attachment
framework for any Odoo model.

* **attachment.related_attachment_category** — groups attachment requirements
  by category.
* **attachment.related_attachment_template** — defines which attachments are
  expected for a given model, with ordered detail lines.
* **attachment.related_attachment_template_detail** — one requirement entry
  with an optional Python condition and category.
* **attachment.related_attachment** — concrete attachment record linked to
  a document (via ``model`` + ``res_id``) and a template detail line.
* **ir.model** extension — specifies trigger fields that cause re-evaluation
  of attachment requirements.
* **mixin.related_attachment** — abstract mixin that injects the attachment
  page into any form view.
